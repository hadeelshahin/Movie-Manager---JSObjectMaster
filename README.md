"# Movie-Manager---JSObjectMaster" 
This project explores:

Adding and deleting properties in objects.
Dynamic property access using square brackets.
Iterating objects with 'for...in' loops.
Utilizing object destructuring and the spread operator for efficient data handling.
Understanding the 'this' keyword variation between global scope, regular functions, and arrow functions.
Demonstrating 'bind', 'call', and 'apply' to manage 'this' references.
Moreover, this project integrates user input validation, clearing input fields post-click, and implementing a movie filtering feature based on titles. The filtered movies are seamlessly injected into a designated list root in the UI.
